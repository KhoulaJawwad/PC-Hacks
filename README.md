# What Language I used
I used Python through PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

# Description
Created a program for people who suffer from a disability called dysgraphia which affects individuals' ability to read and write. The program enables them to solve math equations by using a deep learning model to translate the user's verbal speech to written words and then asks the user to solve the equation orally. At the end, it displays the final answer and if the correct answer doesnâ€™t match the user's the program displays the correct steps in order for the user to resolve the equation.
